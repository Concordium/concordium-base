# Use the same optimization level for building build.rs as for the library
# itself in release mode. This is necessary because some of the dependencies
# (e.g., id) have a `cdylib/staticlib` crate-type which builds some artifacts
# even though they are not needed directly by the build script. This then leads
# to name clashes and failed compilation.
#
# Ideally we would have the crate-type of dependencies feature configurable, but
# this is not supported by Cargo at the moment.
