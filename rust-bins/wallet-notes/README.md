# Libraries

The wallet libraries expose a functionality that will be needed by the wallet.
They expose an interface which takes JSON input and JSON output and it is up to
the user of the libraries to supply correct data and ensure any invariants and
preconditions that are specified.

The library currently exposes the following methods with the following
c-compatible signatures.
- Identity layer
    - `char* create_id_request_and_private_data(const char*, uint8_t*)`
    - `char* create_credential(const char*, uint8_t*)`
    - `char* create_id_request_and_private_data_v1(const char*, uint8_t*)`
    - `char* create_credential_v1(const char*, uint8_t*)`
    - `char* generate_recovery_request(const char*, uint8_t*)`
    - `uint8_t check_account_address_ext(const char*)`
- Regular transactions
    - `char* create_transfer_ext(const char*, uint8_t*)`
- Encrypted transactions
    - `char* create_encrypted_transfer_ext(const char*, uint8_t*)`
    - `char* combine_encrypted_amounts_ext(const char*, const char*, uint8_t*)`
    - `uint64_t decrypt_encrypted_amount_ext(const char*, uint8_t*)`
    - `char* create_pub_to_sec_transfer_ext(char*, uint8_t*)`
    - `char* create_sec_to_pub_transfer_ext(char*, uint8_t*)`
- `void free_response_string(char*)`

After calling a function that returns a `char*` value, it is the
__caller's__ responsibility to free the returned string via the
`free_response_string` function.

The functions that take an `uint8_t*` parameter will either
- successfully generate the required information (see below for the format) and
  set the `uint8_t` parameter to `1`. In this case the returned string is a JSON value.
- or fail and set the `uint8_t` parameter to `0`. In this case the returned string
  is a description of the error.

In all cases the precondition is that the input string is a NUL-terminated
UTF8-string, and the returned string is likewise a NUL-terminated UTF8-encoded string.

## create_id_request_and_private_data

Semantics: Generates a version 0 IdentityObject request, used to request an identity to a IdentityProvider.

This function takes as input a NUL-terminated UTF8-encoded string. The string

In addition the field `"arThreshold"` can be added to specify an anonymity revocation threshold different from the default value, as a JSON encoded byte value.

The output of this function is a JSON object with two keys
- "idObjectRequest" - this is the identity object request that should be sent to
  the identity provider

## create_account_transaction

Semantics: Creates and signs a transaction with the provided values, including the payload in JSON format.
This currently only supports the following transaction types:

| Supported Types                      | type tag       |
|--------------------------------------|----------------|
| Smart contract initializtion         | InitContract   |
| Smart contract update                | Update         |
| Simple transfer                      | Transfer       |

This function takes as input a NUL-terminated UTF8-encoded string. The string
must be a valid JSON object with fields

- `"from"` ... address of the sender account.

- `"expiry"` ... unix timestamp of the expiry date of the transaction.

- `"nonce"` ... nonce of the sender account.

- `"keys"` ... mapping with the keys of the sender account.

- `"type"` ... the transaction type tag (Check the table with supported types above for the expected values).

- `"payload"` ... the transaction's payload as json.

The returned value is a JSON object with the following fields:

- `"signatures"` ... list with signatures of the transaction with the provided keys.

- `"transaction"` ... a hex encoding of the serialized transaction without signatures, i.e. the serialized header, type and payload.

If the `type` is `Update` then the payload must have the following fields
- `amount` (string containing a u64), the amount of CCD to transfer with the call
- `address`, an object with fields `index` and `subindex`, both u64.
- `receiveName`, string, the name of the entrypoint to invoke
- `message`, the parameter to invoke the contract with, encoded as a hex string

Additionally it must have either a field `maxEnergy` or
`maxContractExecutionEnergy`. Both are `u64`. The `maxEnergy` field specifies
the total energy the transaction can spend. If `maxContractExecutionEnergy` is
specified then it only specifies the maximum energy for the execution. The
library will add the overhead based on the number of signatures and the size of
the transaction to the total energy allowed to be spent by the transaction.

An example payload for an `Update` type is 
```json
{
  "amount": "0",
  "address": {
    "index": 1673,
    "subindex": 0
  },
  "receiveName": "CIS1-NFT.transfer",
  "message": "010001010100000000000000004dcc43ed4d3bd27e2c0918ee75b61e61807d77cf587f7b447996b983971a56f000aa05dd88c26078e6315d051fa1e80cf67e9fcec66709cc2688e959864cef2ca50000",
  "maxEnergy": 1000
}
```

# Other change set from the previous version

1. All Amounts are now expected to be strings in JSON. The wallet-proxy will
   serve amounts in this format, and the library will expect them.
2. All Wallet-proxy endpoints are now versioned, concretely this means that they
   are renamed from `/X` to `/v0/X`
3. The `create_id_request_and_private_data` now expects an additional field
   `arsInfos` in the input. This field is obtained in the same way as `ipInfo`,
   via the `GET /v0/ip_info` call.
4. The `create_credential` call has an equivalent change.
5. The `create_transfer`, `create_encrypted_transfer`, `create_pub_to_sec` and `create_sec_to_pub` calls have an additional parameter "energy". This can be
   obtained via a GET request to `/v0/transactionCost?type="simpleTransfer"` or replacing `simpleTransfer` with `encryptedTransfer`, `transferToSecret` or `transferToPublic`.
6. The identity object response will now be wrapped into a version object, i.e.,
   it is of the form
```json
{
  "v": 0,
  "value": {...}
}
```
where {...} is the response as it used to be.
