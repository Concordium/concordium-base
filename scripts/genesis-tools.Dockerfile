# This Dockerfile builds a relatively small docker image that contains all the tools
# needed to generate a genesis block. These tools are
# - genesis_tool to create accounts
# - client to create identity providers, anonymity revokers, and cryptographic parameters
# - generate-update-keys to create update keys
# - genesis to finally combine all the input files into a `genesis.dat` file.

# The builder is based on a base image that has stack, haskell, and rust installed.
# The only argument is the branch name of a concordium-base repository branch, given as 'base_ref'.
