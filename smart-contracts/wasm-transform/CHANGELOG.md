## Unreleased changes

## concordium-wasm 5.0.0 (2024-09-09)

- Revise the compilation of Wasm modules to `Artifacts`. The notion of the
  executable artifact is changed to no longer work with a stack.
- The `Handler` trait is revised to provide `handle_opcode` function information
  about reachability of the instruction that is being handled.
- The `Host` trait is expanded to special-case instructions for resource
  accounting.
- Introduce a new version of cost assignment that is to be used in protocol 7.

## concordium-wasm 4.0.0 (2024-01-22)

- Update contracts-common dependency to version 9.

## concordium-wasm 3.0.0 (2023-08-21)

- `validate_module` is now parameterized by `ValidationConfig` which determines
  which Wasm features should be allowed. The currently supported configurable features are
  - allow access to globals (defined in the current module) in data and element
    initialization sections.
  - allow instructions defined in the [sign extension operators](https://github.com/WebAssembly/sign-extension-ops/blob/master/proposals/sign-extension-ops/Overview.md)
    Wasm proposal.
- `instantiate` and `instantiate_with_metering`'s return type is changed from
  `Artifact` to `InstantiatedModule` which adds metadata on top of the artifact.
