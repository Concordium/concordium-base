# Changelog

## Unreleased changes
- Clarify that energy units used by `cargo-concordium` are "interpreter energy"
  and not the same as NRG.
- Allow the user to only specify the necessary fields in the JSON context files
  - Also allow the `--context` parameter to be omitted, for when no context is needed
