//! The high-level API that is meant to be used by the rest of the project.
//! It exposes two main constructs, the [`PersistentState`] and [`MutableState`]
//! that provide all the needed functionality for the implementation of contract
//! state.
//!
//! The [`PersistentState`] is immutable. It is "persistent" in the sense of
//! persistent data structures, meaning that we never modify it in-place, but
//! always create new versions. This state is used for recording the state of a
//! smart contract at the end of a transaction execution.
//!
//! State modifications are done via the [`MutableState`] which exists during
//! transaction execution. This type is modified in-place and supports rollbacks
//! which are sometimes necessary during the transaction due to contract calls.
//!
//! The overall flow is that a [`PersistentState`] is
//! [thawed](PersistentState::thaw) into a [`MutableState`] when the contract
//! starts execution. Then a contract is executed, and if it terminates with
//! success the resulting state is [frozen](MutableState::freeze) into a
//! [`PersistentState`]. During this process only the part of the original state
//! that has been modified is copied. The new [`PersistentState`] in general
//! retains pointers to parts of the original state. This allows for efficient
//! state updates where we only have to store the parts of the state that are
//! new.
