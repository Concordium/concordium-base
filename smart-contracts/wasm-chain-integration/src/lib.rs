//! This library provides functionality that builds on top of the [Wasm engine](https://docs.rs/concordium-wasm)
//! and adds high-level functions for executing smart contracts on the
//! Concordium chain.
//!
//! Concordium supports two versions of smart contracts, the legacy [`v0`]
//! version and the [`v1`] version. The latter is essentially better in
//! every way. They differ in two main ways
//! - [`v0`] uses message passing for inter-contract communication, and has a
//!   flat state. The state is limited to 16kB and the entire state is written
//!   every time a contract update is done.
//! - [`v1`] uses synchronous calls for inter-contract communication, and its
//!   state is a trie-based structure, which supports efficient partial state
//!   updates. The trie is implemented in the [`v1::trie`] module.
//!
//! Both [`v0`] and [`v1`] modules are structured similarly. The main
//! entrypoints used by users of this library are [`v0::invoke_init`] (resp.
//! [`v1::invoke_init`]) and [`v0::invoke_receive`] (resp.
//! [`v1::invoke_receive`]) functions, and their variants.
//!
//! The respective modules provide more details on the data types involved, and
//! any specifics of the different versions.
//!
//! ## Features
//!
//! This crate has the following features. None are enabled by default.
//!
//! ### `display-state`
//! This feature exposes the function
//! [`display_tree`](v1::trie::PersistentState::display_tree) for displaying the
//! V1 contract state in a reasonably readable format. This is useful for deep
//! inspection of smart contract state, and debugging.
//!
//! ### `async`
//! Exposes construction of smart contract state from streams of key-value
//! pairs, such as those received from the node's API. See
//! - [`try_from_stream`](v1::trie::PersistentState::try_from_stream)
//! - [`from_stream`](v1::trie::PersistentState::from_stream)
//!
//! ### `enable-ffi`
//! This enables foreign function exports. This is an **internal** feature and
//! there are no guarantees about the stability of foreign exports.
//!
//! ### `fuzz-coverage` and `fuzz`
//! These features are also **internal** and exist to support fuzzing. They are
//! used to derive Arbitrary instances and to disable inlining, the latter is
//! necessary since the fuzzer used has bugs which prevent the coverage report
//! being generated when functions are inlined.
