/*
 * A contract that acts like an account (can send, store and accept GTU), but
 * requires n > 1 ordained accounts to agree to the sending of GTU before it is
 * accepted. This is useful for storing GTU where the security of just one account
 * isnâ€™t considered high enough.
 *
 * Withdrawal requests time out if not agreed to within the contract's
 * specified time-to-live for withdrawal requests
 *
 * Withdrawal requests are given IDs to disambiguate otherwise identical
 * requests, since they might have different motivations behind the scenes,
 * making them not-quite fungible (e.g. for accounting purposes it might be
 * necessary for account holders to track a particular named withdrawal).
 *
 * Deposits: Allowed at any time from anyone
 * Withdrawals: Only by accounts named at initialization, and only with the agreement of at least n of those accounts
 *
 * TODO Generalise to sending to _any_ account with the agreement of the named accounts (e.g. to
 * pay someone as a group)?
