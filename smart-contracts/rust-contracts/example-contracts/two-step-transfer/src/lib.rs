/*
 * A contract that acts like an account (can send, store and accept GTU), but
 * requires n > 1 ordained accounts to agree to the sending of GTU before it is
 * accepted. This is useful for storing GTU where the security of just one account
 * isnâ€™t considered high enough.
 *
 * Transfer requests time out if not agreed to within the contract's
 * specified time-to-live for transfer requests
 *
 * Transfer requests are given IDs to disambiguate otherwise identical
 * requests, since they might have different motivations behind the scenes,
 * making them not-quite fungible (e.g. for accounting purposes it might be
 * necessary for account holders to track a particular named transfer).
 *
 * Depositing funds:
 *   Allowed at any time from anyone.
 *
 * Transfering funds:
 *   Only requestable by accounts named at initialization, and only with the
 *   agreement of at least n of those accounts, but can send to any account.
 *
 * At the point when a transfer/withdrawal is requested, the account balance is
 * checked. Either there are not enough funds and the request is rejected, or
 * there are enough funds and the requested sum is set aside (and can be
 * re-added to the balance if the request times out).
 *
 * TODO Consider allowing the person who initially made the request to cancel it, iff it is still
 * outstanding
