 * A contract that acts like an account (can send, store and accept GTU), but
 * requires n > 1 ordained accounts to agree to the sending of GTU before it is
 * accepted. This is useful for storing GTU where the security of just one account
 * isnâ€™t considered high enough.
 *
 * Withdrawal requests time out if not agreed to within the contract's
 * specified time-to-live for withdrawal requests
 *
 * Deposits: Allowed at any time from anyone
 * Withdrawals: Only by accounts named at initialization, and only with the agreement of at least n of those accounts
 *
 * TODO Generalise to sending to _any_ account with the agreement of the named accounts (e.g. to
 * pay someone as a group)?
