/* A contract that acts like an account (can send, store and accept GTU),
 * but requires that no more than x GTU be withdrawn every y time-units.
 *
 * The idea being that perhaps it can act as something like an annuity,
 * or it can be a form of security in that it gives observers time to react
 * to odd movements of GTU before too much damage is inflicted (e.g. by
 * enacting Concordiumâ€™s ability to unmask actors on the chain).
 *
 * Implementation:
 *  - The contract is initiated with a timed_withdraw_limit (corresponding to
 *    x in the above) and a time_limit (corresponding to y).
 *  - When a transfer request is received, it is checked whether the contract
 *    has sufficient funds to process it and whether the accepted recent
 *    transfers within the y last time-units, including the new request, is
 *    below the x withdraw limit. If both terms are met, the transfer is
 *    accepted and put into state.recent_transfers for future reference.
 *  - With every request the outdated requests, i.e. those older than
 *    current_time minus y, are pruned from state.recent_transfers.
