//! This library provides the core API that can be used to write smart contracts
//! for the Concordium blockchain. It aims to provide safe wrappers around the
//! core primitives exposed by the chain and accessible to smart contracts.
//!
//! By default the library will be linked with the
//! [std](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/) crate, the rust standard library,
//! however to minimize code size this library supports toggling compilation
//! with the `#![no_std]` attribute via the feature `std` which is enabled by
//! default. Compilation without the `std` feature requires a nightly version of
//! rust.
//!
//! To use this library without the `std` feature you have to disable it, which
//! can be done, for example, as follows.
//! ```
//! [dependencies.concordium-sc-base]
//! default-features = false
//! ```
//! In your project's `Cargo.toml` file.
//!
//! The library is meant to be used as a standard library for developing smart
//! contracts. For this reason it re-exports a number of definitions from other
//! libraries.
//!
//! # Global allocator.
//! Importing this library has a side-effect of setting  the allocator to [wee_alloc](https://docs.rs/wee_alloc/)
//! which is a memory allocator aimed at small code footprint.
//! This allocator is designed to be used in contexts where there are a few
//! large allocations up-front, and the memory later used during the lifetime of
//! the program. Frequent small allocations will have bad performance, and
//! should be avoided.
//!
//! # Panic handler
//! When compiled without the `std` feature this crate sets the panic handler
//! to a no-op.
