/// the type is an enum then all fields of each of the variants must implement
/// the [`Serial`] trait.
///
/// Fields of structs are serialized in the order they appear in the code.
///
/// ## Enums
///
/// Enums can have no more than 65536 variants. They are serialized by using a
/// tag to indicate the variant, and by default they are enumerated in the order
/// they are written in the source code. If the number of variants is less than
/// or to equal 256 then a single byte is used to encode it. Otherwise two bytes
/// are used for the tag, encoded in little endian.
///
/// ### Specifying the tag byte size using `#[concordium(repr(..))]`
///
/// Optionally, an enum type can be annotated with a `#[concordium(repr(x))]`
/// attribute, where `x` is either `u8` or `u16`. This specifies the number of
/// bytes to use when serializing the tag in little endian.
///
/// A type annotated with `#[concordium(repr(u8))]` can only have up to 256
/// variants and `#[concordium(repr(u16))]` can have up to 65536 variants.
///
/// #### Example
///
/// Example of an enum which uses two bytes for encoding the tag. Here the
/// variant `A` is tagged using `0u16` and `B` is tagged using `1u16`.
///
/// ```ignore
/// #[derive(Serial)]
/// #[concordium(repr(u16))]
/// enum MyEnum {
///     A,
///     B
/// }
/// ```
///
/// ### Specifying the tag value for a variant using `#[concordium(tag = ..)]`
///
/// For each enum variant the tag can be explicitly set using `#[concordium(tag
/// = n)]` where `n` is the integer literal to use for the tag.
/// When using the 'tag' attribute it is required to have the
/// `#[concordium(repr(..))]` set as well. The tag must have a value
/// representable by the type set by `#[concordium(repr(..))]`.
///
/// <i>Note that `SchemaType` currently only supports using a single byte
/// `#([concordium(repr(u8))]`) when using `#[concordium(tag = ..)]`.</i>
///
/// ### Nesting enums with a flat serialization using `#[concordium(forward = ...)]`
///
/// Often it is desired to have a single type representing a parameter or the
/// events. A general pattern for enums is to nest them, however deriving
/// serialization for a nested enum introduces an additional tag for the variant
/// of the top-level enum. The solution is to use the attribute
/// `#[concordium(forward = ...)]` on the variant with a nested enum.
/// This attribute takes a tag or a list of tags which changes the serialization
/// to skip the variant tag and deserialization to match the variant with these
/// tags and forward the deserialization to the nested enum.
///
/// ```ignore
/// #[derive(Serial, Deserial)]
/// #[concordium(repr(u8))]
/// enum Event {
///     SomeEvent(MyEvent),
///     #[concordium(forward = [42, 43, 44, 45])]
///     OtherEvent(NestedEvent),
/// }
/// ```
///
/// For convenience the attribute also supports the values `cis2_events`,
/// `cis3_events` and `cis4_events` which are unfolded to the list of tags used
/// for events in CIS-2, CIS-3 and CIS-4 respectively.
///
/// ```ignore
/// #[derive(Serial, Deserial)]
/// #[concordium(repr(u8))]
/// enum Event {
///     SomeEvent(MyEvent),
///     #[concordium(forward = cis2_events)]
///     Cis2(Cis2Event),
/// }
/// ```
///
/// Setting `#[concordium(forward = n)]` on a variant will produce an error if:
/// - The type does _not_ have a `#[concordium(repr(u*))]` attribute.
/// - If any of the forwarded tags `n` cannot be represented by the
///   `#[concordium(repr(u*))]`.
/// - Any of the forwarded tags `n` overlap with a tag of another variant.
/// - `n` contains a predefined set and the value of `#[concordium(repr(u*))]`
///   is incompatible.
/// - If the variant does _not_ have exactly one field.
///
/// Note that the derive macro does _not_ check forwarded tags matches the tags
/// of the inner type.
///
/// #### Example
///
/// Example of enum specifying the tag of the variant `A` to the value `42u8`.
/// The variant `B` is tagged using `1u8`.
///
/// ```ignore
/// #[derive(Serial)]
/// #[concordium(repr(u8))]
/// enum MyEnum {
///     #[concordium(tag = 42)]
///     A,
///     B
/// }
/// ```
///
/// ## Generic type bounds
///
/// By default a trait bound is added on each generic type for implementing
/// [`Serial`]. However, if this is not desirable, the default bound can be
/// replaced by using the `bound` attribute on the type and providing the
/// replacement.
///
/// Bounds present in the type declaration will still be present in
/// the implementation, even when a bound is provided:
///
/// ### Example
///
/// ```ignore
/// #[derive(Serial)]
/// #[concordium(bound(serial = "A: SomeOtherTrait"))]
/// struct Foo<A: SomeTrait> {
///     bar: A,
/// }
///
/// // Derived implementation:
/// impl <A: SomeTrait> Serial for Foo<A> where A: SomeOtherTrait { .. }
/// ```
///
/// ## Collections
///
/// Collections (Vec, BTreeMap, BTreeSet) and strings (String, str) are by
/// default serialized by prepending the number of elements as 4 bytes
/// little-endian. If this is too much or too little, fields of the above types
/// can be annotated with `size_length`.

/// ```ignore
/// #[derive(SchemaType)]
/// struct MyParam { ... }
///
/// #[receive(contract = "my_contract", name = "some_receive", parameter = "MyParam")]
/// fn contract_receive(
///     ctx: &ReceiveContext,
///     host: &Host<MyState>,
/// ) -> ReceiveResult<A> {...}
/// ```
///
/// ## `return_value="<ReturnValue>"`: Generate schema for the return value.
/// To make schema generation include the return value for this function, add
/// the attribute `return_value` and set it equal to a string literal containing
/// the type used for the parameter. The parameter type must
/// implement the SchemaType trait, which for most cases can be derived
/// automatically.
///
/// ### Example
///
/// ```ignore
/// #[derive(SchemaType)]
/// struct MyReturnValue { ... }
///
/// #[receive(contract = "my_contract", name = "some_receive", return_value = "MyReturnValue")]
/// fn contract_receive(
///    ctx: &ReceiveContext,
///    host: &Host<MyState>,
/// ) -> ReceiveResult<MyReturnValue> {...}
/// ```
///
/// ## `error="<Error>"`: Generate schema for error
/// To make schema generation include the error for this function, add
/// the attribute `error` and set it equal to a string literal containing
/// the type used for the error. The error type must
/// implement the SchemaType trait, which for most cases can be derived
/// automatically.
///
/// ### Example
/// ```ignore
/// #[derive(SchemaType)]
/// enum MyError { ... }
///
/// #[receive(contract = "my_contract", name = "some_receive", error = "MyError")]
/// fn contract_receive(
///     ctx: &ReceiveContext,
///     host: &Host<MyState>,
/// ) -> Result<A, MyError> {...}
/// ```
///
/// ## `fallback`: Create a fallback entrypoint.
/// A contract can have a *single* fallback entrypoint defined.
/// If defined, invocations on missing entrypoint will be redirected to the
/// fallback entrypoint. For fallback entrypoints, the `name` attribute is not
/// allowed. This is because fallback entrypoints always have the empty string
/// as their name.
///
/// To get the name of the entrypoint used for invocation, use
/// `ctx.named_entrypoint()`. The method is available in all receive methods,
/// but is only useful on fallback entrypoints.
///
/// ### Example
/// ```ignore
/// #[receive(contract = "my_contract", fallback)]
/// fn contract_receive(
///    ctx: &ReceiveContext,
///    host: &Host<MyState>,
/// ) -> ReceiveResult<MyReturnValue> {
///     let named_entrypoint = ctx.named_entrypoint();
///     // ...
/// }
/// ```
/// ## `crypto_primitives`: Function can access cryptographic primitives
/// Setting the `crypto_primitives` attribute changes the required signature to
/// include an extra argument `&CryptoPrimitives`, which provides
/// cryptographic primitives such as verifying signatures and hashing data.
///
/// ### Example
/// ```ignore
/// #[receive(contract = "my_contract", name = "some_receive", crypto_primitives)]
/// fn some_receive(
///     ctx: &ReceiveContext,
///     host: &Host<MyState>,
///     crypto_primitives: &CryptoPrimitives,
/// ) -> ReceiveResult<MyReturnValue> {...}
/// ```
